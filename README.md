# SCT_ML_4
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build and train a hand gesture recognition model. The script automatically loads images from a dataset, augments the training data to improve robustness, and trains a deep learning model to classify different hand gestures. The final trained model is then saved for future use.
